# Climate sensitivity definitons

A short note that defines terms used in our discussions of climate sensitivity and feedback

## Definitions

$E$ ($J\,m^{-2}$)
: total energy in an atmosphere/ocean column

$F$ ($W\,m^{-2}$)
: radiative forcing due to temperature independent processes like volcanoes, oil combustion

$R$  ($W\,m^{-2}$)
:radiative response,  net downward radiation at the top of the atmosphere due to temperature dependent processes like surface warming, sea-ice melting.

$\Delta E$,  $\Delta R$ $(W\,m^{-2})$
: change from pre-industrial values.  The assumption is that both $\Delta E$ and  $\Delta R$
  were zero in the year 1850, and have changed since then.

## Stock and flow equation for change in  energy

The stock and flow equation for the energy in a column, given the above definitions, is:

$$
\frac{d\Delta E}{dt} =\Delta F + \Delta R
$$(eq:stock)

### Stock and flow with Planck feedback

Recall from the Day 8 Modtran worksheet that we defined the Planck feedback $f_{planck}$ as the
extra amount of upward radiative flux $-I_{up}$ that would be generated by a 1 K change in surface temperature.  That change in the upward flux means that the radiative response $\Delta R$ has to change. 

In symbols this is:

$$
\Delta R = f_{planck} \Delta T
$$(eq:delR)
where $f_{planck}$ is called the **Planck feedback factor**.

According to page 4 of the worksheet, 

$$
f_{planck} = -5.67\ W\,m^{-2}\,K^{-1}
$$(eq:planck)

Using {eq}`eq:delR` and {eq}`eq:planck`, we can rewrite {eq}`eq:stock` as:


$$
\frac{d\Delta E}{dt} =\Delta F + f_{planck} \Delta T
$$(eq:stock2)


## Linking  the climate feedback to the climate sensitivity

In equilibrium:  $d \Delta E/dt = 0$, so {eq}`eq:stock2` becomes:

$$
\Delta F + f_{planck} \Delta T
$$(eq:stock3)

or rearranging:


$$
\Delta T = -\frac{1}{f_{planck}}  \Delta F
$$(eq:stock4)

Another way to write this is:


$$
\begin{align}
\lambda &= -1/f \\
\Delta T &= -\lambda \Delta F
\end{align}
$$(eq:stock5)
where $\lambda$ ($K/(W\,m^{-2})$) is called the **climate sensitivity parameter**.


### Equilibrium climate sensitivity

Finally, suppose we doubled the $CO_2$ from its preindustrial concentration of 280 ppm.  We know
from the Day 9 reading that that corresponds to $\Delta F = 3.8\ W\,m^{-2}$.  The
**equilibrium climate senstivity (ECS)** is defined as the final 
equilibrium temperature change due to $CO_2$ doubling, and from the above, if only the Planck
feedback was operating, we would get:

$$
ECS = \Delta T = \lambda 3.8 = \frac{1}{5.67} 3.8 = 0.7\ K
$$
