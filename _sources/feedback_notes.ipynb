    "# Climate sensitivity definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "A short note that defines terms used in our discussions of climate sensitivity and feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "$E$ ($J\\,m^{-2}$)\n",
    ": total energy in an atmosphere/ocean column\n",
    "\n",
    "$F$ ($W\\,m^{-2}$)\n",
    ": radiative forcing due to temperature independent processes like volcanoes, oil combustion\n",
    "\n",
    "$R$  ($W\\,m^{-2}$)\n",
    ": radiative response,  net downward radiation at the top of the atmosphere due to temperature dependent processes like surface warming, sea-ice melting.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Delta E$, $\\Delta F$ and  $\\Delta R$ $(W\\,m^{-2})$\n",
    ": change from pre-industrial values.  The assumption is that  $\\Delta E$, $\\Delta F$ and  $\\Delta R$\n",
    "  were zero in the year 1850, and have changed since then.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stock and flow equation for change in  energy\n",
    "\n",
    "The stock and flow equation for the energy in a column, given the above definitions, is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{d\\Delta E}{dt} =\\Delta F + \\Delta R\n",
    "$$(eq:stock)\n",
    "\n",
    "In words {eq}`eq:stock` says that since the year 1850 we have applied a forcing $\\Delta F$ to\n",
    "the earth, and it has generated a feedback response $\\Delta R$.  Because of this, the\n",
    "energy of the planet, $\\Delta E$ is changing with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stock and flow with Planck feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the Day 8 Modtran worksheet that we defined the Planck feedback $f_{planck}$ as the\n",
    "extra amount of upward radiative flux $-I_{up}$ that would be generated by a 1 K change in surface temperature.  That change in the upward flux means that the radiative response $\\Delta R$ has to change. \n",
    "\n",
    "In symbols this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta R = f_{planck} \\Delta T\n",
    "$$(eq:delR)\n",
    "where $f_{planck}$ is called the **Planck feedback factor**.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to page 4 of the worksheet, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f_{planck} = -5.67\\ W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}\n",
    "$$(eq:planck)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using {eq}`eq:delR` and {eq}`eq:planck`, we can rewrite {eq}`eq:stock` as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{d\\Delta E}{dt} =\\Delta F + f_{planck} \\Delta T\n",
    "$$(eq:stock2)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linking  the climate feedback to the climate sensitivity\n",
    "\n",
    "In equilibrium:  $d \\Delta E/dt = 0$, so {eq}`eq:stock2` becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta F + f_{planck} \\Delta T = 0\n",
    "$$(eq:stock3)\n",
    "\n",
    "or rearranging:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta T = -\\frac{1}{f_{planck}}  \\Delta F\n",
    "$$(eq:stock4)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to write this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\lambda &= -1/f \\\\\n",
    "\\Delta T &= \\lambda \\Delta F\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$(eq:stock5)\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ ($K/(W\\,m^{-2})$) is called the **climate sensitivity parameter**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equilibrium climate sensitivity\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, suppose we doubled the $CO_2$ from its preindustrial concentration of 280 ppm.  We know\n",
    "from the Day 9 reading that that corresponds to $\\Delta F = 3.8\\ W\\,m^{-2}$.  The\n",
    "**equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS)** is defined as the final \n",
    "equilibrium temperature change due to $CO_2$ doubling, and from the above, if only the Planck\n",
    "feedback was operating, we would get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "ECS = \\Delta T = \\lambda \\times 3.8 = \\frac{1}{5.67} 3.8 = 0.7\\ K\n",
