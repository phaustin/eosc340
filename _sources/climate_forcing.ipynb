    "dry air $c_p=1004\\ J/kg$ which links the change in energy to the change in temperature.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "E_{layer} = \\rho_{air} c_p T \\Delta z\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the energy of the entire atmosphere is the integral of all these layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E_{atmos} = \\int_0^\\infty \\rho_{air} c_p T dz\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, if we define the average temperature $T_{avg}$ then we can write:\n",

    "Using that same approach to get the value of $M$ between a surface pressure of 1000 hPa and the top\n",
    "of the atmosphere where the pressure = 0 gives a values for $M$ of about 10,000 $kg\\,m^{-2}$.  $M$ is a constant,\n",
    "because mass is conserved in the atmosphere, and $c_p$ is also constant.  \n",
